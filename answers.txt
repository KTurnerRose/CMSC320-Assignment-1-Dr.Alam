Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: A version-control system stored outside of my local system will 
protect 
work/projects from getting lost or accidentally deleted.  Git also makes 
group 
collaboration on a project easier.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how 
it might help

Answer: Journalists can use data science to investigate trends in a 
population or 
the effects of an event on a population.  Data science can also be used 
for 
reporting projections for events journalists report on such as predicted 
election 
outcomes for specific areas of a country based on voter registration data.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging integrates changes of both branches together, creates a 
merge 
commit and preserves the commit history of both branches being combined 
(creating 
a 'diamond shaped' commit history timeline).  Rebasing creates a rebase 
commit 
where one branch 
is added on top of another branch and the second branch's commit history 
is 
removed.  
This creates a linear commit history timeline.
